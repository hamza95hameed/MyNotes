install
composer require tymon/jwt-auth

## choose tymen/jwt after this command , It will make file in config (jwt.php)
php artisan vendor:publish

## generate secreat key
php artisan jwt:secret

## add this in USER model
use Tymon\JWTAuth\Contracts\JWTSubject;

## add these functions

// Addition for JWT authentication
public function getJWTIdentifier()
{
    return $this->getKey();
}

public function getJWTCustomClaims()
{
    return [];
}

## go to config \ auth.php
and do this (change your driver from token jwt)
   'api' => [
            // 'driver' => 'token',
            'driver' => 'jwt',
            'provider' => 'users',
            'hash' => false,
        ],

## Copy the controller class and place it in api folder
and add this
use App\Http\Controllers\Api\Controller;

after that make a construct in controller class that you have copied

## set default driver of api for all requests in seperate class  
It is very important as we have to set the driver to api while working with jwt
public function __construct(){
    auth()->setDefaultDriver('api');
}


## make a user with email / password

## Now make a login controller and try to login  , and in return you will get a token
save it and send it in header with every request
In header you will send it using bearer token.


## JWT THEORY ##

## How jwt is made ##
1) header
2) payload
3) signature
