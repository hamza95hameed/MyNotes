Directory configuration:
Laravel should always be served out of the root of the "web directory" configured for your web server. 
i.e Public in root , other folders out of root attached  with index file
---

Application key : 
Setting application is important. If the application key is not set, your user sessions and other encrypted data will not be secure!

--- 
.env :
Environment file having the environment variables.

if (App::environment('local')) {
    // retrive any variable from environment
}
---

// You may easily access your configuration values using the global config helper function from anywhere in your application.
$value = config('app.timezone');

Routes:
++ web.php => manage sessions, csrf protection , routing for website
++ api.php => manage stateless part of application , does'nt manage session.
++ console.php => 
This file is where you may define all of your Closure based console
commands. Each Closure is bound to a command instance allowing a
simple approach to interacting with each command's 

E.g:

protected function commands()
{
    // Register a new command `say:hello` using the shorthand
    // syntax. This command will be registered automatically
    // and does not have to be explicitly registered.
    $this->command('say:hello {name}', function($name) {
        $this->info("Hello, {$name}");
    });
}

++ channels.php => 

The channels.php file is where you may register all of the event broadcasting channels that your application supports.

-------------
Deployement :

**When deploying your application to production, you should make sure that you run the config:cache Artisan command during your deployment process:

php artisan config:cache

**If you are building a large application with many routes, you should make sure that you are running the route:cache Artisan command during your deployment process:

php artisan route:cache

----------
The Basics : 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1) Routing
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


**) handle multiple request

Route::match(['get', 'post'], '/', function () {
    //
});
 
Route::any('/', function () {
    //
});


**) return view

If your route only needs to return a view, you may use the Route::view method. 
Like the redirect method, this method provides a simple shortcut so that you do not have to define a full route or controller. 
The view method accepts a URI as its first argument and a view name as its second argument.
 In addition, you may provide an array of data to pass to the view as an optional third argument:

Route::view('/welcome', 'welcome');
 
Route::view('/welcome', 'welcome', ['name' => 'Taylor']);

**) Required parameters

Route::get('posts/{post}/comments/{comment}', function ($postId, $commentId) {
    //
})

**) Optional Parameters
Occasionally you may need to specify a route parameter, but make the presence of that route parameter optional. You may do so by placing a ? mark after the parameter name. Make sure to give the route's corresponding variable a default value:

Route::get('user/{name?}', function ($name = null) {
    return $name;
});
 
Route::get('user/{name?}', function ($name = 'John') {
    return $name;
});



**) Regular expression routes

Route::get('user/{name}', function ($name) {
    //
})->where('name', '[A-Za-z]+');
 
Route::get('user/{id}', function ($id) {
    //
})->where('id', '[0-9]+');
 
Route::get('user/{id}/{name}', function ($id, $name) {
    //
})->where(['id' => '[0-9]+', 'name' => '[a-z]+'])


**) Named routes
