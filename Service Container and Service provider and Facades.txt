Service Providers : 
---------------------
Service provider is the place where a laravel application is bootstraped.
In service provider we register components which are required to run a laravel application .
The core components includes Routes, Middleware , Events, Cookie , etc.

If you open the config/app.php file included with Laravel, you will see a providers array.
These are all of the service provider classes that will be loaded for your application.
By default, a set of Laravel core service providers are listed in this array.
These providers bootstrap the core Laravel components, such as the mailer, queue, cache, and others. 
Many of these providers are "deferred" providers, meaning they will not be loaded on every request,
but only when the services they provide are actually needed.

Facades 
-------
Provide static interface to class
Using Facades we don't need to make object to use a function in a class.
We can call a non static function using this.
Other wise we need to add a make a object call static funtion of a class.
---STEPS TO MAKE FACADE ---
Make a normal custom class
make a function in it
make facade and register it in config.app alias
Use it !
